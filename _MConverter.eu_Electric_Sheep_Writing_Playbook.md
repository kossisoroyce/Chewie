The Philosophy

This playbook codifies a writing style for Electric Sheep Africa
research articles. The goal is to write pieces that are useful, clear,
and grounded---with a voice that carries the weight of ideas without the
burden of academic pretension.

We draw from two traditions: Paul Graham\'s clarity and precision, and
the African literary tradition\'s rootedness in story, proverb, and
community. Graham teaches us that good writing is bold but true, simple
but not shallow. Achebe teaches us that the story is our
escort---without it, we are blind.

The result should feel like sitting with someone wise who speaks
plainly, uses concrete examples, and occasionally says something that
makes you stop and think for a long time.

Core Principles

1\. Useful Writing

Graham\'s formula: **Importance × Novelty × Correctness × Strength**

Every piece should tell people something true and important that they
didn\'t already know, stated as strongly as possible without becoming
false.

- **Importance:** Does this matter? To whom? How much?

- **Novelty:** Will readers learn something? Will they see something
  familiar in a new way?

- **Correctness:** Is this actually true? Have you verified it? Would
  you bet money on it?

- **Strength:** Are you stating this as boldly as you can without being
  wrong?

**Test:** If you don\'t learn something from writing it, don\'t publish
it.

2\. The Story is Our Escort

African literary tradition treats storytelling as communal wisdom, not
decoration. A proverb is not ornament---it compresses generations of
observation into a handful of words.

In our writing, this means: ground abstract ideas in concrete stories.
Don\'t just explain a concept---show it in action. Don\'t just state a
principle---illuminate it with an example that readers can feel.

*The abstract should always have a story underneath it, holding it up.*

3\. Write Simply

Simple writing is not dumb writing. It\'s writing that gets out of the
way of the ideas. The goal is what Graham calls *saltintesta*---ideas
that leap into your head so naturally you barely notice the words that
carried them.

- Use ordinary words

- Use short sentences (mostly)

- Don\'t show off

- Cut until it hurts, then cut a little more

**Exception:** When a complex sentence or unusual word serves the idea,
use it. But never by accident.

4\. Be Present in the Writing

Unlike dry academic prose, you should be present in the text. Not as
ego, but as guide. You\'re thinking alongside the reader, not lecturing
from above.

This means you can say \"I think\" when you\'re uncertain. You can admit
when something surprised you. You can acknowledge the limits of your
knowledge. This isn\'t weakness---it\'s honesty, and readers can feel
it.

5\. Ground Ideas in Place

The \"hint of Africanness\" isn\'t decoration. It\'s grounding. When
relevant, use examples from African contexts. Reference problems as they
appear here, not just as they appear in Silicon Valley or London.
Acknowledge the specific constraints and opportunities of building on
this continent.

This isn\'t provincialism---it\'s precision. Ideas become more universal
when they\'re rooted in specifics.

Voice Guidelines

What We Sound Like

| **We Are**     | **We Are Not**   | **Why It Matters**                                                  |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Direct         | Blunt or rude    | Clarity serves readers. Rudeness alienates them.                    |
| Confident      | Arrogant         | We publish what we\'re sure of. That\'s confidence, not arrogance.  |
| Conversational | Casual or sloppy | Write like you talk---but like you talk when you\'re being careful. |
| Grounded       | Provincial       | Local specifics illuminate universal ideas.                         |
| Thoughtful     | Hedging          | Qualification is a skill, not a tax. Use it precisely.              |
| Curious        | Naive            | Wonder comes from knowing enough to see what\'s strange.            |

The Proverb Test

For key insights, ask: could this be compressed into a proverb? Not that
you should write in proverbs, but the best insights have that
quality---they\'re dense with meaning, they feel true the moment you
hear them, and they stick.

*Examples of proverb-dense sentences:*

- \"The context window is a prosthetic. External memory systems are
  prosthetics.\"

- \"The story is our escort---without it, we are blind.\"

- \"You can have continuous learning, but within a channel carved by
  deeper structures that don\'t change.\"

- \"Self-stimulation is what makes the stream continuous rather than a
  series of connected pools.\"

Structure

The Basic Arc

Most research articles should follow a simple arc:

**1. Hook:** Start with something that makes readers want to continue. A
surprising fact, a counterintuitive claim, a question they didn\'t know
they had.

**2. Stakes:** Why does this matter? What\'s at stake if we get this
wrong, or right?

**3. Exploration:** Work through the problem. Show your thinking. Use
examples. Let the reader think alongside you.

**4. Insight:** The core claim. What did you figure out? State it
clearly.

**5. Implications:** So what? What follows from this? What should
readers do or think differently?

This isn\'t a rigid template. Some pieces will be pure exploration. Some
will be responses. Some will be provocations. But most will follow some
version of this arc.

Opening Lines

The first sentence matters more than any other. It should do
something---make a claim, ask a question, create tension. Never open
with throat-clearing.

**Bad openings:**

- \"In this paper, we will examine\...\" (Academic fog)

- \"It is widely known that\...\" (If it\'s widely known, why write
  about it?)

- \"Since the dawn of time\...\" (False gravitas)

**Good openings:**

- \"The first thing I realized was that everyone was wrong about X.\"

- \"There\'s a question nobody seems to be asking.\"

- \"We\'ve been building AI memory systems backwards.\"

- \"The mask that dances has one face; the one who watches has many.\"

Paragraph Structure

Each paragraph should do one thing. If you\'re doing two things, you
need two paragraphs.

Lead with the point. Don\'t save the insight for the end of the
paragraph---readers might not get there.

Vary paragraph length. Short paragraphs create emphasis. Long paragraphs
allow development. Alternating keeps readers engaged.

The Editing Process

Fast, Then Slow

Write the first draft quickly. Try out ideas. Don\'t self-censor. Get
the shape of the argument down without worrying about elegance.

Then spend days editing. Graham reads some sentences 100 times before
publishing. The goal is to remove every word that doesn\'t earn its
place, every sentence that doesn\'t do work.

The Morris Technique

Named after Robert Morris: don\'t publish anything unless you\'re sure
it\'s worth reading. This means ruthless cutting. If a sentence seems
off, don\'t publish it. If a whole section isn\'t earning its keep,
delete it.

You can\'t ensure every idea you have is good. But you can ensure every
idea you publish is, by not publishing the ones that aren\'t.

The Briar Test

When you proofread, notice passages that snag your attention in an
annoying way. They become like briars catching your sleeve. Sometimes
they\'re clumsily written. Sometimes you\'re not sure they\'re true.
Don\'t publish until all the briars are gone.

Editing Checklist

- Is the opening sentence doing something?

- Does every paragraph have one clear point?

- Are abstract ideas grounded in examples?

- Could any sentences be cut without losing meaning?

- Are there any \"briars\"---passages that snag uncomfortably?

- Is every claim as strong as it can be without being false?

- Would you bet money on the main claims?

- Did you learn something from writing this?

- Is there at least one insight that could be compressed into a proverb?

- Does the piece feel like it has a soul---like someone real wrote it?

The African Element

This isn\'t about sprinkling in Yoruba proverbs for flavor. It\'s about
a fundamentally different orientation to knowledge and writing.

Communal Knowledge

African oral traditions treat knowledge as communal, not individual. A
story belongs to the community. A proverb carries generations of wisdom.
When you write, you\'re not just expressing your views---you\'re
participating in a longer conversation.

**Practical implication:** Acknowledge what you\'ve inherited. Don\'t
pretend ideas came from nowhere. Situate your thinking in relationship
to others.

Functional Art

In the African tradition, art is functional. Stories exist to transmit
values, preserve history, teach wisdom. Writing isn\'t separate from
life---it serves life.

**Practical implication:** Ask: what is this piece for? What work does
it do in the world? Pure intellectual display isn\'t enough.

The Oral Cadence

Achebe brought Igbo speech patterns into English prose. The result was
writing that felt alive, that carried the rhythm of actual human speech.

**Practical implication:** Read your writing aloud. Does it sound like a
person talking? Does it have rhythm? Could it be spoken around a fire?

Proverbs as Compression

\"Proverbs are the palm oil with which words are eaten.\" They make
ideas digestible. They compress wisdom into memorable form. They create
shared reference points.

**Practical implication:** Your key insights should have proverb-like
qualities: dense, memorable, true in a way that resonates.

Specific Examples

When discussing AI development challenges, ground them in African
contexts:

- The unreliability of power infrastructure

- The cost of cloud compute when paid in naira

- The absence of local datasets for local problems

- The talent that builds elsewhere because it can\'t build here

- The unique opportunities in problems that don\'t exist in the Bay Area

This isn\'t complaint literature. It\'s precision. The constraints shape
the solutions.

Final Thoughts

Writing well is thinking well made visible. The work isn\'t just in the
words---it\'s in the ruthless clarity about what you actually believe,
what you can actually defend, what actually matters.

The goal is pieces that people read and then think about for a long time
afterward. Pieces that change how readers see something. Pieces that
feel like they were written by someone who cared---about the ideas,
about the reader, about getting it right.

We\'re building something new here. African AI research, communicated
with clarity and weight. The world doesn\'t need more jargon-filled
papers. It needs ideas that leap into your head and stay there.

*\"The world is like a Mask dancing. If you want to see it well, you do
not stand in one place.\"*
